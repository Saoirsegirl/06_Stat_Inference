# Loading and Summarization of Data Set: ToothGrowth 
Let's load our data and look at a summary and the structure of is contents.  
```{r summary}
data(ToothGrowth); str(ToothGrowth); summary(ToothGrowth)
```  

We can see there are 60 observations of 3 columns, that the first and third columns are numerics - and the second column is a factor with two levels. The summary further tells us the quantile breakdown of each of the numeric columns.  

# Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose.
